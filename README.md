# RiteCache - The Smart Cache Knows Your Data

In general, RiteCache uses the Rust programming language to reproduce the Learning Cache Replacement algorithm. 
The paper, written by Vietri et. al., can be found [here](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotstorage18/hotstorage18-paper-vietri.pdf) and the slides they wrote about the paper can be found [here](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/hotstorage18_slides_martinez.pdf).

The code structure and implementation are heavily influenced by [Ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto), which is a fast, concurrent cache library written in the Go language.
